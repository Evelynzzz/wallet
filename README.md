- Multiple languages supported

## Testing in a Browser

> **Note:** This method should only be used for development purposes. When running Copay in a normal browser environment, browser extensions and other malicious code might have access to internal data and private keys. For production use, see the latest official [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/releases/).

Clone the repo and open the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trias-lab/wallet.git
cd copay
```

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install and start Copay:

```sh
npm install
npm run apply:copay
npm run start
```

Visit [`localhost:8100`](http://localhost:8100/) to view the app.

## Unit & E2E Tests (Karma & Protractor)

To run the tests, run:

```
 npm run test
```

## Testing on Real Devices

It's recommended that all final testing be done on a real device – both to assess performance and to enable features that are unavailable to the emulator (e.g. a device camera).

### Android

Follow the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/) to set up your development environment.

When your developement enviroment is ready, run the `start:android` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run start:android
```

### iOS

Follow the [Cordova iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/) to set up your development environment.

When your developement enviroment is ready, run the `start:ios` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run start:ios
```

### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)

The desktop version of Copay currently uses Electron. To get started, first install Electron on your system from [the Electron website](https://electronjs.org/).

When Electron is installed, run the `start:desktop` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:copay
npm run start:desktop
```

## Build Copay App Bundles

Before building the release version for a platform, run the `clean-all` command to delete any untracked files in your current working directory. (Be sure to stash any uncommited changes you've made.) This guarantees consistency across builds for the current state of this repository.

The `final` commands build the production version of the app, and bundle it with the release version of the platform being built.

### Android

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm install
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run final:android
```

### iOS

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm install
npm run apply:copay
npm run prepare:copay
npm run final:ios
```

### Push Notifications

Push notification doesn't work on iOS 12 due to an update of Xcode and plugin `cordova-plugin-fcm`.

A current workaround is to comment out the line to prevent the removal of the file during the debug build (line 56 in platforms/ios/cordova/lib/copy-www-build-step.js).

## Configuration

### Enable External Services

To enable external services, set the `COPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION` or `BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION` environment variable to the location of your configuration before running the `apply` task.

```sh
COPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION="~/.copay/externalServices.json" npm run apply:copay
# or
BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION="~/.bitpay/externalServices.json" npm run apply:bitpay
```

## Copay Backups and Recovery

Since v1.2 Copay uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets. The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.

Information about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/backupRecovery.md

Previous versions of Copay used files as backups. See the following section.

It is possible to recover funds from a Copay Wallet without using Copay or the Wallet Service, check the [Copay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery/tree/master).

## Wallet Export Format

Copay encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). To extract the private key of your wallet you can go to settings, choose your wallet, click in "more options", then "wallet information", scroll to the bottom and click in "Extended Private Key". That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!

The backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.
Depending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in Copay v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since Copay version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):

| Copay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |
| ≥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48’)  | P2SH         |

Using a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.

BIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so Copay address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.

Since version 1.5, Copay uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the other copayers extended public keys.

## Bitcore Wallet Service

Copay depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and Copayer synchronization. A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`. Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within Copay. BWS also allows Copay to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).

## How to Verify Copay Signatures

1.  Download the `copay@bitpay.com` public key (`gpg --recv-keys 1112CFA1`)
2.  Download Copay binary (`$FILENAME`) and signature file (`$FILENAME.sig`)
3.  Verify the signature by running:

```bash
$ gpg --verify \
 $FILENAME.sig \
 $FILENAME

# It should return:
Good signature from "Copay (visit copay.io) <copay@bitpay.com>"
```

### Public Key for Copay Binaries

Instead of importing the public key from a public server (like gnu's) you can grab it from here:

## A Note on Production Readiness

While Trias is being used in production in private, permissioned
environments, we are still working actively to harden and audit it in preparation
for use in public blockchains.
We are also still making breaking changes to the protocol and the APIs.
Thus, we tag the releases as _alpha software_.

In any case, if you intend to run Trias in production,
please [contact us](mailto:contact@trias.one) and [join the chat](https://www.trias.one).

## Security

To report a security vulnerability, [bug report](mailto:contact@trias.one)

## Contributing

All code contributions and document maintenance are temporarily responsible for TriasLab.

Trias are now developing at a high speed and we are looking forward to working with quality partners who are interested in Trias. If you want to join，please contact us:

### Upgrades

Trias is responsible for the code and documentation upgrades for all Trias modules. In an effort to avoid accumulating technical debt prior to Beta, we do not guarantee that data breaking changes (ie. bumps in the MINOR version) will work with existing Trias blockchains. In these cases you will have to start a new blockchain, or write something custom to get the old data into the new chain.
